I personally find codewars to be useful at providing small problems that you can quickly solve even in new language. 
While many complain that you should learn the language first, I think this only applies to people who only know 0-2 languages.
Eventually learning a new language is mostly learning the quirks, cool features, limitations, and how the the standary libary renames names things.

Plus with tools like Copilot, you can ask the AI for the right libary function.

After you get your submission together, you can glance at other peoples solutions, and HERE is where codewars shines.
There are amazingly clever uses of the language to solve the problem.
While many times readability is lost, you do have a chance to see wholely new approaches that you would'nt see without this language.
